📝 Applants

A full-stack CRUD web application inspired by Instagram, Applants lets users share, update, and delete plant photos and descriptions — designed with a nature-loving community in mind.

📝 About the Project

This app allows users to create profiles, upload plant photos, and interact with posts. It includes:

- Full CRUD functionality: users can create, read, update, and delete posts.
- A simple and intuitive interface built with HTML and vanilla JavaScript.
- Image upload handling and server-side routing with Express and Node.js.
- MongoDB for data persistence of users and post content.

This project was one of my early back-end builds and served as a great hands-on introduction to combining databases with front-end interactivity.

⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- MongoDB with Mongoose
- Express.js
- Node.js
- HTML5
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- EJS templating
- Cloudinary for image hosting
- Multer for handling image uploads

💼 School Project

Applants was developed as a school project during my software engineering course. It taught me the flow of data from front-end to back-end and how to manage user-generated content securely and efficiently.
